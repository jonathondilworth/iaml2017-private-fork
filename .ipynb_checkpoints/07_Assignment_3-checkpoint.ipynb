    "## Description of the dataset\n",
    "In this assignment our goal is to recognize objects in images of realistic scenes. There are 19 different classes of object e.g. person, dog, cat, car, etc. The dataset derives from several thousands photographs harvested from the web. Each object of a relevant class has been manually annotated with a bounding box. Images can contain none, one or multiple objects of each class. We have prepared a [website](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/iaml/2014/assts/asst3/images.html) where you can view the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to detect whether images contain a person or not - a binary classification problem. To save you time and to make the problem manageable with limited computational resources, we have preprocessed the dataset. We will use the [Bag of Visual Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model_in_computer_vision) representation. Each column of the dataset (which is not an lable), refers to a 'visual word'. Each image is represented by a 500 dimensional vector that contains the normalized count for each of 500 different visual words present in the respective image (a similar representation is used for the spambase dataset, just for real words). See the Appendix at the bottom of the notebook for more information. The image data is thus a $N \\times 500$ dimensional matrix where `N` is the number of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full dataset has 520 attributes (dimensions). The first attribute (`imgID`) contains the image ID which allows you to associate a data point with an actual image. The next 500 attributes (`dim1`, ..., `dim500`) are a normalized count vector for each visual word. The last 19 attributes (`is_class`) are the labels - 1 means the class is present in the image. In most of the experiments (unless explicitly noted otherwise) you will only need the `is_person` attribute and the 500 dimensional feature vector. **Do not use the additional class indicator attributes as features** unless explicitly told to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part A we provide you with a training (`train_images partA.csv`) and a validation (`valid_images partA .csv`) dataset. In Part B we provide three data sets: a training set (`train_images partB.csv`), a validation set (`valid_images partB.csv`), and a test set (`test_images partB.csv`). The training and validation set contain valid labels. In the test set the labels are missing. The files are available from the GitHub repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: *Throughout the assignment you will be given various versions of the dataset that are relevant\n",
    "to a particular question. Please be careful to use the correct version of the dataset when instructed to do so.\n",
    "If you use the wrong version of the dataset by mistake no marks will be awarded.*"

    "Scikit-learn offers a [`LogisticRegressionCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV.html) module which implements Logistic Regression with builtin cross-validation to find out the optimal `C` parameter. You can specify the range for the `C` parameter, as well as the cross-validation method you want to use with the `Cs` and `cv` parameters, respectively. Use the `C` range you set up in Question 1.12 and the 3-fold cross-validation iterator from Question 1.11. Once again, train the models by using the `lbfgs` optimisation method and display the optimal value for the parameter `C`. Finally, display the classification accuracy on the validation set. Check your results are consistent with those from Question 1.14!"

    "Now we turn to the kernel coefficient `gamma` parameter. By using the same procedure as in the previous question, estimate the classification accuracy of an SVM classifier with RBF kernel while you vary the `gamma` parameter in a logarithmic range `logspace(-5, 0, 10)`. Fix the penalty parameter `C=1.0`.\n",

    "Plot the mean cross-validated classification accuracy against the parameter `gamma` by using a log-scale for the x-axis. Display the highest obtained mean accuracy score and the value of `gamma` which yielded it.  Label axes appropriately.\n",

    "Finally, train a classifier by using the optimal value for this parameter (without using cross-validation at this stage) and report the classification accuracy on the training and validation sets. "

    "Is the classification accuracy on the validation set higher than in previous questions (1.22-1.23)? If not, can you explain why? Can you think of a way of further improving the performance of the classifier? You don't need to implement your suggestion at this stage.

    "Insofar as I am certain that my results are inaccuracte, the classification accuracy on the optimised parameters selected in question 1.23 is actually lower than those presented in the previous two questions. This could be due to many reasons. Firstly, there could be errors in the code / data structures (as I have already stated, I'm fairly certain some of these results are wrong). But, I imagine a more appropriate answer would be that cross-validation has not been implemented in this instance. We are simply using hold-out validation across a training and a testing set, so the algorithm is probably overfitting the training data resulting in a lower generalisation across the validation set. In addition, the values of c and gamma are from two different ranges (as compared to the two previous experiments), as we have varied more than one variable in the experiment, it really discredits any potential claims we can make about the performance of the algorithm. We could improve the performance of the classifier by performing a more appropriate sensitivity analysis. This would mean varying the hyperparameters gamma and C between a larger set of values to find a more appropriate optimal pair. We could also use much more data and more folds to train the classifier. Problems associated with these approaches are: we require more compute and more data. We may not have these additional resources."

    "You might have noticted that so far, we have used cross-validation for optimising the various tuning parameters (e.g. regularisation parameter in logistic regression, SVM kernel parameters) rather than hold-out validation, although we did have access to a validation set. Why do you think this is a good/bad idea? Give one advantage and one disadvantage of the two different approaches. Which one would you trust more in practice?"

    "Using more folds (KFold, or cross validation) increases the generalisation performance of an algorithm becuase as it's  being trained on different sets of data it's becoming more versitle (I suppose this is somewhat off topic, it's kind of a similar idea to dropout in deep neural nets). The reason why it's becoming more versitle is because it's not overfitting the training set. Then, when the algorithm is tested on multiple sets of unseen data (K validation sets) - you're gaining a better indication of generalisation, because you're essentially simulating a more realistic real world experience (the algorithm seeing unseen data). By taking the average accuracy across K validation folds, you're gaining a good insight into the performance of the algorithm in the real world, assuming your data is fairly representative of real world examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my own projects and my own experiments, I think it's a good idea because I don't have a large enough dataset to accurately represent a large enough portion of real world examples, so for me - it's going to benefit the performance of my classifer (maybe not in the above examples because I'm pretty sure there is something wrong). But it might be a bad idea for a company who has access to a huge amount of resources, just because it's additional unnecessary compute; and as a business is primarily concerned with increasing profit margins, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever to waste money on cross-validation compute when they have a large enough dataset to accuractely train a classifier that performs as well as one trained using cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would trust using KFold / cross validation more in practice, but whether I would use it or not would depend on my use case. For small projects with limited resources - cross validation is great. For huge companies with datasets the size of the moon, perhaps not.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would be interested in knowing if there are any disadvantages in terms of classification accuracy when using KFold / cross-validation on a very large dataset (that's very representative of the data it's going to be used in real world situations) - any insights on this in the feedback would be appriciated.

    "The first thing to note is that the most important features are actually candidates for target variables. The validation score is much better in this instance than in the previous instance. If your data is such that you can include X number of objects that the image is not, it allows the classifier to learn what NOT the image is and can therefore use that data to make a more accurate prediction. However, if all of the target variables are included within the validation data, it doesn't really make much sense, because you already know what the image is. It's essentially already labelled through a process of elimination. It's like saying: well, there 20 things this object could be, but it's definatly not 19 of these, therefore it must be the class that is left out. Therefore, this really isn't very practical. However, you could increase the classification accuracy by including some target variables if your data has access to them and the real world data you're going to be using on this clssifier also has access to a subset of these potential target variables. When I use the word target variables, what I'm really saying is: labels."

    "**Important:** The classification performance metric that we will use for this part is the *cross-entropy* or *logarithmic loss* (see the labs). You should familiarise yourself with the metric by reading the `sklearn` [user guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#log-loss) and [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html#sklearn.metrics.log_loss). To estimate this metric you will need to evaluate probability outputs, as opposed to discrete predictions which we have used so far to compute classification accuracies. Most models in `sklearn` implement a `predict_proba()` method which returns the probabilities for each class. For instance, if your test set consists of `N` datapoints and there are `K` classes, the method will return a `N` x `K` matrix."

    "Visual words are based on [Scale-invariant feature transforms (SIFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform). SIFT features are essentially local orientation histograms and capture the properties of small image regions. They possess attractive invariance properties which make them well suited for our task (you can read more about SIFT features in [D.Lowe, IJCV 60(2):91- 110, 2004](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94), but the details don't matter for the purpose of this assignment). Each SIFT feature is a 128 dimensional vector. From each image many SIFT features are extracted, typically > 2500 per image (features are extracted at regular intervals using a 15 pixel grid and at 4 different scales). To obtain visual words a representative subset of all extracted SIFT features from all images is chosen and clustered with k-means using 500 centres (such use of the k-means algorithm will be discussed in detail during the lecture). These 500 cluster centres form our visual words. The representation of a single image is obtained by first assigning each SIFT feature extracted from the image to the appropriate cluster (i.e. we determine the visual word corresponding to each feature by picking the closest cluster centre). We then count the number of features from that image assigned to each cluster (i.e. we determine how often each visual word is present in the image). This results in a 500 dimensional count vector for each image (one dimension for each visual word). The normalized version of this count vector gives the final representation of the image (normalized means that we divide the count vector by the total number of visual words in the image, i.e. the normalized counts sum to 1 for each image)"
